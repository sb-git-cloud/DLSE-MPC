# DLSE_neural_networks
This Matlab toolbox provides some tools that, interfacing
with the Matlab Neural Network Toolbox, allows to design, train and
optimize neural networks as difference of log-sum-exp functions and
as ratio of posynomials.

To install the toolbox in Matlab add all files and folders including subfolders to the Matlab path.
